# Custom Math Library

This is a custom math library written in Haskell that can be used to encode mathematical expressions so that they can be simplified, evaluated, or even partially differentiated. The library also includes some handy tools for all your calculus midterm studying needs! 

## Getting Started
You'll find the different aspects of the math library split up into neatly contained modules. These include: ```ExprType.hs``` for the skeleton of mathematical expressions, ```ExprDiff.hs``` for the nitty-gritty of the mathematical functions, ```ExprParser.hs``` for parsing strings into mathematical expressions that can be operated on by the library, and ```ExprTest.hs``` for testing of the mathematical library.
